guide on how to sync katran to oss.

today it is done manually (T_T. at least script is
on it's way so this could be done just by running shell. mb one day we would
use proper FB tool for that). you need to sync
only lib folder to facebookincubator/katran github project.
(https://github.com/facebookincubator/katran/tree/master/katran)
after sync make sure that all internal files (TARGETS) are not copied.
